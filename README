autotools-unittest
==================

The autotools-unittest is a minimal starter kit when writing C++ library
with autotools, google test(gtest) and google mock(gmock).
This include gtest-1.7.0 and gmock-1.7.0,
so you can use those testing framework without installation.

Requirements
------------

* Autoconf
* Automake
* Libtool

Example
-------

0. Download the package and extract it

```
$ wget http://github.com/downloads/eiichiroi/autotools-unittest/autotools-unittest-0.2.0.tar.gz
$ tar xzf autotools-unittest-0.2.0.tar.gz
```

1. Change directory name to your library name(ex. mylib) and move into the directory

```
$ mv autotools-unittest-0.2.0 mylib
$ cd mylib
```

2. Change package name from 'autotools-unittest' to your library name

```
$ ./scripts/change_package_name.sh mylib
Changing package name from 'autotools-unittest' to 'mylib' ... Are you sure? [yes/NO]: yes
===========================================================================

* ./src/autotools-unittest

These directory names listed above will be changed. Are you sure? [yes/NO]: yes

* ./src/autotools-unittest ... done.

===========================================================================

* ./configure.ac
* ./test/sample_test.cpp
* ./Makefile.am

These contents of files listed above will be changed. Are you sure? [yes/NO]: yes

* ./configure.ac ... done.
* ./test/sample_test.cpp ... done.
* ./Makefile.am ... done.
```

3. Build sample codes

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
```

4. Build gtest, gmock and unit tests for sample codes, and run them

```
$ make check
```

5. Write your library

Tips
----

* Use coverage reporting

You can use coverage reporting feature if lcov is installed in your environment.

```
$ ./configure --enable-coverage
$ make coverage
...
Successfully created coverage reports into ./coverage directory.
```

Please check "./coverage/index.html".

By default, source codes will be complied with no-optimization(-O0 option) to get more precise results.

If you would like to get coverage reports with optimization, please use COVERAGE_OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS variables like this.

```
$ make coverage COVERAGE_OPTIMIZATION_FLAGS="-O2"
```

Please take care that coverage reports with optimization results in unexpected one.

* Use coding style checks

You can use coding style checker(cpplint) if python is installed in your environment.

```
$ make check-style
```

If you would like to check coding style with cpplint's options, please use CPPLINT_OPTIONS variables like this.

```
$ make check-style CPPLINT_OPTIONS="--verbose=4"
```

* Use advanced gtest options

You can use advanced gtest options via environment variables(GTEST_xxx).

For example, you can filter test cases as follows.

```
$ GTEST_FILTER="square.*" make check
```
